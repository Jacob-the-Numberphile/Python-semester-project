# Python-semester-project

This repository contains the completed works of the Python and SQL final semester project at San Jose State University.


The topic for this project was the Covid 19 Data Analysis Project. 
This project was much more of a collaborative effort thatn the Milton Friedman Data Analysis Project; 
however, my role in this project was still very involved and rewarding. In this semester project, our 
goal was to acquire, analzse, and visualize the data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the state of California 
over various counties over time. Also, my visualizations deliniated between the pre and post vaccine periods, 
which yielded interesting results. After one of the group members cleaned the data, my goal was to visualize the 
relationship betweeen hospitolizations and unemployment rates in the early months of the Covid Pandemic in various ways. 
First, illustrated the relationship with a scatterplot, which revealed that for the pre-vaccine period, the 
hospitalizations tend to stay below 10,000 and have a high variability in terms of emplyment. In contranst, the post 
vaccine unemplyment rated universally stay at 10-12%, while experiancing a high variability in terms of hospitalizations. 
Furthermore, I analyzed the two features over time, which revealed an initial spike in unemployment which gradually reduces 
to a normal period over time, and hospitalizations gradually increasing until a sudden and pronounced spike in the October to 
to February time period.
